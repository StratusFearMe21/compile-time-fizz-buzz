# Compile time Fizz Buzz

This is the most efficiant implementation of Fizz Buzz that I could come up with. When most people do Fizz Buzz, they don't even think about compile time, but in this case the calculation of Fizz Buzz happens entirely during compile time. The only thing that happens at run time is the printing of the already calculated Fizz Buzz string.
